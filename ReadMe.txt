Payton Hall: Thank you for taking the time to look over my resume, I had fun working on this lab and getting it done. It took me about 60 minutes, give or take. This is the first time I've really used roman numerals so it took a little to understand what was going on. Thank you, please let me know if I forgot to add anything or you need more files from me. Thank you,
Payton Hall.
